# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification from MRI Scans

This project is a deep learning-based web application that classifies brain MRI images into one of four categories:
- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using Keras and is served through a Flask web interface.




## 📊 Dataset
This project uses the Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset publicly available on Kaggle, curated by Sartaj Bhuvaji.

📁 Dataset Structure
The dataset contains 3,264 labeled MRI images categorized into four classes:

- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

Images are grayscale and vary in size but are typically resized to 224×224 pixels during preprocessing.

📌 Distribution (Approximate)
Tumor Type	Number of Images
Glioma Tumor	926
Meningioma Tumor	937
Pituitary Tumor	901
No Tumor	500

🧪 Data Use
All images are preprocessed and normalized before being passed to the model.

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets using an 80-10-10 or similar split.

Augmentation techniques (like rotation, flipping, zooming) may be used to improve model generalization.
